Final word: if you're like me, you'll be tempted to read about everything, especially
when you see the vastness of knowledge at point #4, 
and you'll unknowingly prioritize that over building.

Please STOP. Build many small games, that are different from each other,
and only read theory occasionally. There are 3 major reasons for this:
- building is the ONLY way to truly learn something;
- ONLY search for what you NEED. You don't borrow the whole library,
just the thing you need at that time -- say a book on WW2. Similarly,
only search for what you're building, and even then, abstain from 
reading more than building, as you'll feel demotivated by the lack
of progress in the end;
- you'll FEEL how much better a particular coding practice will help
you, after doing it the "wrong" way first. Feeling and Knowing are 
2 different things, and guess which one sticks better.
